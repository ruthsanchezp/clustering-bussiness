# Clustering Analysis on Small Business Data

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analysis focused on identifying patterns and grouping states in the U.S. based on their small business economic data. Small businesses represent a crucial part of the U.S. economy, comprising 99% of all businesses and almost 50% of employment. Our goal is to use clustering techniques to better understand the small business landscape and provide insights for potential policy-making.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is derived from the U.S. Small Business Administrationâ€™s annual report. It includes economic indicators for small businesses across 51 U.S. states. The dataset consists of 16 variables and contains missing values (represented as asterisks). A detailed description of each variable can be found in the accompanying data dictionary.
